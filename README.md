## Palettes

* [Viridis](https://sjmgarnier.github.io/viridis/), "a series of color maps that are designed to improve graph readability for readers with common forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color maps are also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to black-and-white for printing."
* [Flexoki 2.0](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki), "an inky color scheme for prose and code," which "bring the feeling of analog color to digital emissive screens... colors that [feel like watercolor pigments on paper](https://bsky.app/profile/stephango.com/post/3lf5wyhiups2i)."

## Color combinations to avoid

This chart is the result of a frustrating search for a simple list of color combinations to avoid if you want to accommodate various forms of colorblindness. Each intersection below lists one of the conditions that could cause someone to confuse the colors at the intersection, but there could be more than one condition that affects a particular color combination. If you have a correction or know of other problematic color combinations, feel free to email me (rabdill@umn.edu) or, even better, submit a pull request.
